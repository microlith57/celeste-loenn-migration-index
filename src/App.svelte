  <h1>Celeste Lönn Migration Index</h1>

  <p>
    This is a list of all Celeste helpers that still have unmigrated plugins (that is, they have Ahorn
    plugins without corresponding Lönn plugins), sorted by the number of mods that depend on them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is generated automatically (each time you load the page) from <a
      href="https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/custom-entity-catalog"
      >max480's Celeste Custom Entity and Trigger List</a
    >, so it updates when that list updates.
